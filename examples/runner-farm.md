## Important Changes to the DevHub Runner Farm - Action Required

Dear colleagues,

We would like to inform you about important changes that come with the introduction of the new DevHub version 18.0. After this update, registration tokens will no longer be supported. You can find more information about this change on the official DevHub website: [Deprecations](https://docs.devhub.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#support-for-rest-api-endpoints-that-reset-runner-registration-tokens).

To ensure the continuity of your projects that use our runners from the DevHub Runner Farm, we ask you to provide us with your new runner authentication token. Without this new token, we cannot continue to host your runners in our DevHub Runner Farm.

For more information about the new runner process from the DevHub Runner Farm, please visit the following page: [FAQ](https://techlauncher.pages.devops.telecom.example.com/Dokumentation/Extern/content/runner/external/faq.html).

We thank you in advance for your cooperation and support during this transition. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Best regards,

TechLauncher Team
